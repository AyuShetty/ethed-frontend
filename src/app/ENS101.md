# ENS 101: Names, Profiles, and Safe Display

Welcome to ENS 101. This course explains what a name like “alice.eth” is, why it is useful, and how the site uses it to show a friendly identity next to an account. No prior knowledge needed.

## What will be learned:

- Claim a simple name and set it as the main name that apps can show.
- Add a picture and a short bio to the name’s public card so apps can read it.
- See how the site safely shows a name only when checks match.

### Who this is for:

- First‑time learners, students, and teammates building a public profile.

### How long it takes:

- 30–45 minutes total, with short videos per lesson.

## Next steps:

- Open the lessons in order. Each lesson has a quick task at the end.

# Lesson 1: What is ENS?

ENS gives a simple name like “alice.eth” that apps can show next to an account. Think of it like saving a contact on a phone—the name is easier to read than the background code.

Why names help:

- Human‑readable: names are simple to recognise and remember.
- One tiny profile: a name can carry a display picture, a bio, and links.
- Safer display: good apps check that the name truly belongs to the connected account before showing it.

How it works in simple terms:

- Directory: keeps track of who owns which name.
- Profile card: stores picture, bio, and links for the name.
- Lookups go both ways: the name should point to the account, and the account should declare that name as its main name. When both match, the site shows the name confidently.

# Lesson 2: Get a Name

Goal:

- Search for a name, register it, and remember to renew it later.

Steps:

1) Open the official ENS app (use the link from the course page to avoid look‑alikes).
2) Search for the chosen name (e.g., learner‑name.eth).
3) If available, register for at least 1 year. This can be renewed later.
4) Save a calendar reminder to renew 1–2 weeks before expiry.

Safety tips:

- Double‑check spelling before paying.
- Use the official link from the course page.

Watch:

- Step‑by‑step registration (4–6 min): VIDEO_URL

Task:

- Register a name on a test network or main network (as preferred).
- Add a reminder in the calendar to renew.

# Lesson 3: Make It Your Main Name

Goal:

- Set the name as the “Primary name” so apps can show it next to the account.

Steps:

1) In the ENS app, open the name page.
2) Find “Primary name” (sometimes called “reverse record”).
3) Select the name and confirm.

Why this matters:

- Apps look up the account’s declared main name. If set, they show it. If not, they fall back to a short code.

Watch:

- Set Primary name (3 min): VIDEO_URL

Task:

- Set the Primary name.
- Disconnect and reconnect the account in a favorite app to see if the name appears.

# Lesson 4: Add Your Profile

Goal:

- Add a display picture, bio, and website link to the name’s public card.

Steps:

1) Open the name in the ENS app.
2) Find “Records” or “Profile”.
3) Add:
    - avatar: link to an image (PNG/JPG; or upload to a host and paste the URL)
    - description: a short bio (1–2 lines)
    - url: personal site or social link

Tips:

- Keep the image square (e.g., 512×512) for clean thumbnails.
- Keep the bio short and friendly.

Watch:

- Profile records walkthrough (4 min): VIDEO_URL

Task:

- Add an avatar, a bio, and one link.

# Lesson 5: See It Work in the Site

Goal:

- Connect the account on the demo page and check that the name appears only when the safety check passes.

What the site does:

- When an account connects, the site:
    - finds the account’s main name,
    - confirms the name points back to the same account,
    - only then shows the name and avatar.

Steps:

1) Open the demo page.
2) Connect the account.
3) If both checks match, the site shows the name and avatar. If not, it shows a short account preview.

Watch:

- Live demo (3–4 min): VIDEO_URL

Task:

- Toggle the Primary name off and on to see how the site reacts.

# Lesson 6: Badges with Subnames

Goal:

- Understand how the project can issue small child‑names (subnames) as badges.

What a subname is:

- A child under a parent name, for example:
    - cohort2025.alice.eth
- It acts like a lightweight certificate learners can keep.

How this project uses it:

- After finishing lessons, a “Claim badge” button can create a subname.
- The badge can include simple text fields like:
    - course: ENS 101
    - cohort: 2025
    - issued_by: EthEd

Steps (demo flow):

1) Click “Claim badge”.
2) Confirm the action.
3) View the subname in the profile or supported apps.

Watch:

- Badge claim demo (3–4 min): VIDEO_URL

Task:

- Claim a test badge if available, or view a sample badge on the demo page.

# Appendix (Dev Note)

This site shows a name only when a simple two‑step check passes.

Pseudocode:

- Get the account’s declared main name.
- Resolve that name to its account.
- If both match, show the name and avatar; otherwise, show a short account preview.

Optional code sample (Python):

```python
from web3 import Web3
from ens import ENS
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(RPC))
ns = ENS.from_web3(w3)
addr = ns.address("alice.eth")
name = ns.name(addr)
verified = (name == "alice.eth")
```
