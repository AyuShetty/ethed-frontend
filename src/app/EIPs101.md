## 1. Ethereum in plain language

Imagine a global computer that anyone can use and no single company controls. Ethereum is that computer. Programs on this computer are called smart contracts: small pieces of code that do exactly what they say, visible to everyone, and enforced by thousands of machines cooperating to agree on the same state.

![Ethereum is an open-source blockchain known for its smart contracts and the cryptocurrency ether (ETH).](https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1754723701/pplx_project_search_images/5601a1f2f211ab3c5cb292a63cc3e244352e06b5.png)

Over time, even the best systems need upgrades. New features, fixes, or standards must be proposed, debated, and agreed to without a CEO pressing a button. That is where EIPs come in. EIPs are the public, transparent “upgrade notes” and “blueprints” that the community reads, critiques, and—when ready—adopts.

A helpful analogy: think of Ethereum as a city. Smart contracts are buildings and services. EIPs are the building codes and city planning rules that keep everything safe, compatible, and evolving. When a new type of bridge is needed, an EIP is the document that proposes its design, explains why it is better, and specifies exactly how to build it.

***

## 2. What is an EIP?

An Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) is a structured document that does three simple things:

- States a problem clearly.
- Proposes a precise solution.
- Explains why this solution is the right one now.

Each EIP is public. Anyone can read the exact text, comment, and suggest improvements. Editors maintain format and process quality; developers and researchers examine technical details; application and wallet teams consider user impact; the wider community discusses tradeoffs.

EIPs are not marketing posts or opinion pieces. They are technical specifications with rationale—enough detail that different teams can implement the same behavior without ambiguity.

***

## 3. The kinds of EIPs

There are three main kinds of EIPs, and one of them has subcategories:

![Types and Categories of Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/eac9e89c1eb8db6390ed8c5d98b9dad0/9e579543-1b65-4096-9602-d3cce3724f65/3704514c.png)

- Standards Track: changes that affect how Ethereum or apps work in practice. These include:
    - Core: changes to the protocol itself, such as fee mechanics or new opcodes.
    - Networking: how Ethereum nodes talk to each other.
    - Interface: client APIs and RPCs that apps and wallets call.
    - ERC (application-level standards): conventions like token interfaces so apps interoperate.
- Meta: changes to processes outside the protocol, such as how EIPs are managed or reviewed.
- Informational: best practices or guidance meant to educate, not to enforce.

A simple mental model: if the change affects how software must behave to remain compatible, it is likely Standards Track; if it updates rules about how the community works, it is likely Meta; if it explains a practice or approach, it is likely Informational.

***

## 4. The lifecycle: how an idea becomes a standard

Follow one story to make this concrete. Consider a fictional proposal: “Rentable NFTs.” The idea is that an NFT owner can grant time-bound usage rights to another account without transferring ownership.

- Idea: Someone notices many apps re-implement rentals differently, causing confusion. A forum thread collects examples and pitfalls. The community says, “a standard would help.”
- Draft: The author writes a proper EIP document: a short abstract, motivation with real app pain points, a specification that defines events and functions with exact semantics, and rationale explaining each design choice. An editor assigns a number and places it in the repository as Draft.
- Review: Developers of marketplaces and wallets test the interface in small demos. Feedback leads to clearer event names and a safer default for revocation. The spec tightens wording around “rental expiry.”
- Last Call: For a fixed review window, the community focuses on final objections. Wording is polished, examples are clarified. No breaking changes are introduced at this point.
- Final: The standard is accepted. Popular marketplaces and several wallets implement it. Apps can rely on consistent behavior, and audits can reuse standard reasoning.

Alternative outcomes also exist. If discussion stalls for months, an editor may mark it Stagnant so attention moves to active work. If the author decides to withdraw the idea, it becomes Withdrawn. Some documents, like process guidelines, live as Living because they evolve continuously.

## 5. Anatomy of an EIP (with a guided example)

A well-written EIP reads like a clear engineering spec. Below is a condensed, realistic skeleton for the fictional “ERC-NNNN: Rentable Non-Fungible Tokens.” Each section includes example text to show the tone and level of precision expected.

Title
“ERC-NNNN: Rentable Non-Fungible Tokens”

Abstract
“This standard defines a minimal interface for time-bound rental of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Owners can grant usage rights to a renter until an expiry timestamp without transferring ownership. The standard specifies functions, events, and state requirements that enable consistent integration across wallets and marketplaces.”

Motivation
“NFT-based applications (games, galleries, memberships) often require temporary access without giving up ownership. Today, projects build custom rental contracts with inconsistent semantics for revocation, renewal, and transfer during active rentals. This fragmentation complicates integrations and audits. A simple, opt‑in interface allows apps to support rentals consistently.”

Specification

- Interface name: IERCXXXXRentable
- New events:
    - Rented(tokenId, owner, renter, expiresAt)
    - RentalEnded(tokenId, endedAt, reason)
- Required functions:
    - rentOut(tokenId, renter, expiresAt) external
    - renterOf(tokenId) view returns (address renter, uint64 expiresAt)
    - endRental(tokenId) external
- Semantics:
    - Only the current owner may call rentOut.
    - During an active rental, transfer of the token by the owner ends the rental.
    - If expiresAt is in the past, calls to endRental must emit RentalEnded with reason “Expired.”
    - renterOf returns zero address and zero expiry if no active rental exists.
- Error conditions:
    - rentOut must revert if expiresAt ≤ current block time + minimal duration (implementation-defined but recommended ≥ 60 seconds).
    - rentOut must revert if tokenId does not exist.

Rationale
“Events mirror common wallet needs: one to start, one to end, with machine-parseable reasons for indexing. The owner-only rentOut preserves owner sovereignty. Ending on transfer simplifies asset movement and reduces footguns where a renter persists after sale. The zero-address convention for ‘no renter’ aligns with existing ERC patterns.”

Backwards Compatibility
“This standard does not modify ERC‑721 core semantics. It adds an interface that contracts may optionally implement. Existing ERC‑721 contracts remain valid. Marketplaces can feature-detect the interface and enable rentals only when present.”

Security Considerations
“Renter logic must not grant ownership privileges. The renter MUST NOT be treated as ownerOf for transfers or approvals. Care is required around reentrancy on rentOut and endRental; recommended practice is to apply checks-effects-interactions and emit events after state changes. Time-based expiry depends on block timestamps and inherits their small variance.”

Reference Implementation (illustrative)
“An example wrapper contract implements IERCXXXXRentable for existing ERC‑721 tokens via composition. The wrapper holds tokens and exposes rental controls while preserving original ownership semantics. This pattern enables rentals for collections that cannot be upgraded.”

Test Cases (outline)

- Rent, query renterOf, observe events.
- Early end by owner; attempt re-rent to a new renter.
- Transfer during active rental; assert rental ended.
- Expiry path; endRental after expiry emits expected reason.
- Non-existent token reverts.

A complete proposal also includes a short description line and author metadata, and references to discussion threads so reviewers can follow the history.

## 6. Reading real EIPs without headaches

A beginner’s reading method that works well:

- Read the Abstract and Motivation together as a single story: “What hurt, and what is the fix.”
- Skim the Specification once for shape: names of functions, events, and any constants.
- Jump to Rationale to understand why the odd-looking parts are there.
- Revisit Specification and underline exact semantics. Where does it revert? What does it guarantee?
- Scan Backwards Compatibility and Security to understand practical risks for apps and wallets.

This order mirrors how most implementers think: is the problem real, is the solution precise, is the design justified, and what could go wrong.

***

## 7. Case studies that make EIPs intuitive

EIP‑20 (ERC‑20 tokens)
Problem: early fungible tokens each used different function names and event shapes, breaking wallets and exchanges.
Core idea: a single minimal interface (balanceOf, transfer, approve/transferFrom, events) so any token “just works.”
Impact: exchanges, wallets, and protocols could integrate thousands of tokens predictably; the DeFi stack later built on that uniformity.

EIP‑721 (NFTs)
Problem: unique digital assets needed a first-class identity and ownership model different from fungible tokens.
Core idea: every token has a unique id; interfaces expose ownership and safe transfers; metadata conveys what the token represents.
Impact: consistent handling of art, tickets, in-game items, and identity primitives.

EIP‑1559 (fee market change)
Problem: fee estimation oscillated under congestion, leading to overpayment or stuck transactions.
Core idea: a predictable base fee per block that adjusts automatically with demand and is burned, plus an optional tip to prioritize inclusion.
Impact: smoother fee estimation for wallets and more consistent user experience during busy periods.

EIP‑4844 (blob-carrying transactions)
Problem: rollups needed cheap, temporary data to post proofs without storing all of it forever on chain.
Core idea: “blobs,” a special, time-limited data space with its own fee market separate from normal gas.
Impact: major cost reductions for rollups, enabling cheaper L2 transactions and scaling the ecosystem.

EIP‑4337 (account abstraction via contracts)
Problem: externally owned accounts (EOAs) were too rigid for better UX like social recovery or sponsored gas.
Core idea: a standardized flow where smart contract wallets validate “user operations,” with bundlers and optional paymasters.
Impact: gasless experiences, programmable validations, and recovery workflows without changing the base protocol.

EIP‑7702 (EOA delegation, high level)
Problem: migrating from EOAs to smart accounts without changing familiar addresses is hard.
Core idea: allow an EOA to temporarily delegate execution to contract logic while remaining compatible with existing tooling.
Impact: a gentler path toward richer account features with minimal user friction.

Each example follows the same pattern: one clear pain point, one carefully scoped interface or rule, and long-term gains from shared expectations.

## 8. Following the process with EIPsInsight

EIPsInsight is a purpose-built companion for tracking, understanding, and drafting EIPs. A practical way to learn with it:

- Open the dashboard and glance at status distributions. This sets expectations: not every idea becomes Final, and that is healthy.
- Choose one EIP—say, EIP‑4844—and scroll its status history. Notice how many conversations and iterations precede acceptance.
- Visit the editors’ activity view to appreciate review load and timelines. This builds empathy for the process and helps authors write clearer drafts.
- Use advanced filtering to find EIPs similar to a current problem. Reading three related EIPs often reveals a pattern for a better design.

This habit—scan, pick, read, compare—turns a massive repository into a focused weekly practice.

***

## 9. Drafting a first EIP with EIPsInsight’s Proposal Builder

The Proposal Builder transforms a daunting process into a guided writing session. A credible first draft emerges naturally by moving section by section.

- Start with the smallest possible, real problem in an area of familiarity. For instance, a metadata convention that repeatedly causes bugs in one’s own project.
- In the Builder, fill Title (short and descriptive) and a one‑line Description. Write the Abstract as two or three sentences any developer can read without context.
- Write the Motivation as a story with concrete failures: “wallet X and marketplace Y interpret Z differently, leading to A and B bugs.” Name specific classes of apps rather than generalities.
- Draft the Specification last, even though it sits before Rationale. By now the mental model is clear. Specify exact names, argument types, return values, and events. State what must revert and when.
- Use Rationale to justify every choice that could have been different: naming, event shapes, default behavior, and any guardrails. Link design choices back to the failures mentioned in Motivation.
- Capture Backwards Compatibility and Security with clear, actionable statements: what implementers must not assume, and where time or reentrancy could bite.
- Switch to preview mode to catch formatting errors and awkward phrasing. The Builder’s validation hints nudge the draft toward the house style EIP editors expect.
- Export the Markdown, open a pull request in the EIPs repository, and include links to discussion threads so reviewers can trace context. From here, iteration begins—small edits often matter more than grand rewrites.

A helpful mindset: the Proposal Builder is not just a form; it is a thinking scaffold. When a section feels hard to write, that is a signal the idea needs more sharpening.

## 10. Workshop: build a minimal standard in 90 minutes

A guided session that consistently works for beginner cohorts:

Phase 1 — Problem capture (15 minutes)
Pick one recurring integration pain from a familiar app category: for example, a standard way to express “trial access” for a membership NFT.

Phase 2 — Concrete examples (15 minutes)
Write down three real failure cases that happened or could plausibly happen. Each example should end in a user-visible bug.

Phase 3 — Interface sketch (20 minutes)
Define exactly two events and two functions that would prevent those bugs. No more. Name them plainly. Write one paragraph per function describing returns and required reverts.

Phase 4 — Rationale and risks (20 minutes)
Explain why each choice is safer or simpler than alternatives. List two backwards-compatibility notes and two security pitfalls with mitigations.

Phase 5 — Polish in the Builder (20 minutes)
Paste each section into the Builder, preview, fix wording, and export. Share drafts for peer review.

The outcome is a compact, credible Draft-ready EIP that demonstrates understanding of purpose, process, and precision.

## 11. Contributing beyond authorship

The ecosystem needs more careful readers than authors. High‑quality reviews move proposals faster than any single champion can.

A useful review comment looks like this:

- Quotes the exact sentence in question.
- States the ambiguity or risk in practical terms.
- Proposes precise wording that would remove the ambiguity.
- Mentions a concrete integration scenario affected by the change.

Good etiquette is simple: be specific, be kind, and be ready to change one’s mind when presented with a better argument. Editors and authors remember reviewers who help with clarity.

***

## 12. Glossary in one breath

- Account abstraction: letting account logic be programmable, often via smart contracts, to improve UX like recovery or sponsored fees.
- Base fee: the protocol‑set fee per block that adjusts with demand and is burned.
- Blob: special, temporary data space for rollups, priced separately from normal gas.
- Client: software that runs Ethereum (e.g., execution and consensus clients).
- Editor: a maintainer who ensures EIPs follow format and process guidelines.
- ERC: application‑level standard within the EIP framework.
- Gas: unit measuring computational work on Ethereum.
- Last Call: fixed, short window for final objections before acceptance.
- Rationale: section explaining why a specification is designed the way it is.
- Rollup: L2 system posting proofs and data to Ethereum for security.

***

## 13. Final guidance

A strong EIP feels inevitable when read: the problem was real, the solution was the smallest that could work, and every sharp edge has a guardrail. Starting small, writing precisely, and iterating publicly are the reliable ingredients. With EIPsInsight as the compass—for tracking, comparing, and drafting—beginners become credible contributors far sooner than expected.

### The lifecycle: how an idea becomes a standard

An idea graduates from informal discussion to a Draft with an assigned number, moves to Review for community and implementer feedback, enters a short Last Call window for final objections, and becomes Final when stable and adopted; some documents become Living, others can be marked Stagnant or Withdrawn.
